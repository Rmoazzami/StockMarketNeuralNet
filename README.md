# StockMarketNeuralNet
An Algorithm trader that utilized neural networks to asses the impacts of news articles and technical indicators on the price of the stock.

Created for the 2018 Vanderbilt Hackathon, the files aim to gather news data from API's and rate their sentiment and impact 
on the community and couple that with technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Band, Stoch, Aroon up/down)
to feed into a neural network that is trained on the data 
(Goal was 250,000 data points but due to most clean datasets being sold at a premium we were only able to gather a fraction of
that cleanly)

The Neural Net's result was failure, although data collection could be considered a success
